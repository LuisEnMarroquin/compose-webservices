# code-server

`code-server` is [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) running on a
remote server, accessible through the browser.

- **Consistent environment:** Code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a
  consistent dev environment. develop more easily for Linux if you have a
  Windows or Mac, and pick up where you left off when switching workstations.
- **Server-powered:** Take advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests,
  compilations, downloads, and more. Preserve battery life when you're on the go
  since all intensive computation runs on your server.

### Requirements

- Minimum GLIBC version of 2.17 and a minimum version of GLIBCXX of 3.4.15.
  - This is the main requirement for building Visual Studio Code. We cannot go lower than this.
- A 64-bit host with at least 1GB RAM and 2 cores.
  - 1 core hosts would work but not optimally.
- Docker (for Docker versions of `code-server`).

### Known Issues

- Creating custom VS Code extensions and debugging them doesn't work.
- Extension profiling and tips are currently disabled.

### Extensions

`code-server` does not provide access to the official
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). Instead,
Coder has created a custom extension marketplace that we manage for open-source
extensions. If you want to use an extension with code-server that we do not have
in our marketplace please look for a release in the extensionâ€™s repository,
contact us to see if we have one in the works or, if you build an extension
locally from open source, you can copy it to the `extensions` folder. If you
build one locally from open-source please contribute it to the project and let
us know so we can give you props! If you have your own custom marketplace, it is
possible to point code-server to it by setting the `SERVICE_URL` and `ITEM_URL`
environment variables.

### Telemetry

Use the `--disable-telemetry` flag to completely disable telemetry. We use the
data collected to improve code-server.
