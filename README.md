# compose-webservices

Multiple webservices using `docker-compose`, behind `nginx-proxy`

## Create `.env` file

Create a file to store your environment variables

```shell
# Email for letsencrypt cert renew
EMAIL=me@localhost.com
# You server's domain name
DOMAIN=localhost.com
```

## Start services

At first you need to start the `nginx` service, it includes `nginx`, `letsencrypt` and `whoami` containers

```shell
docker-compose --project-name nginx up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

### Coder

```shell
docker-compose --project-name code -f docker-code.yml up -d --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

### Gitlab

```shell
docker-compose --project-name gitlab -f docker-gitlab.yml up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

### Jenkins

```shell
docker-compose --project-name jenkins -f docker-jenkins.yml up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

### Netdata

```shell
docker-compose --project-name netdata -f docker-netdata.yml up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

### Portainer

```shell
docker-compose --project-name portainer -f docker-portainer.yml up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```

Generate new htpasswd, edit `command` property on `docker-portainer.yml`

```shell
docker run --rm httpd:2.4-alpine htpasswd -nbB admin <password> | cut -d ":" -f 2
```

* If any password passed though cli has an `$` you must escape it using double `$$`

## Test if it works locally

You can test that this actually worked locally without any changes

### Linux CLI

If it works you'll see the something like `I'm 999999999` after running the following command:

```shell
curl -H "Host: whoami.localhost.com" localhost
```

### Windows

Add the following lines to this file (admin is required): `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

```shell
127.0.0.1 localhost.com
127.0.0.1 code.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 whoami.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 gitlab.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 jenkins.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 netdata.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 portainer.localhost.com
```

Then visit `whoami.localhost.com` with any web browser

## Watch large workspace VSCode

* Follow this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_visual-studio-code-is-unable-to-watch-for-file-changes-in-this-large-workspace-error-enospc)

## MySQL

```shell
# Get inside container
docker exec -it wordpress_db_1 /bin/bash
# Login into MySQL as root
mysql -p # Will show you an interactive prompt to enter your password
mysql -pp92ls8qkau28 # Add your password in the same line // No space between -p and the password text
# Login into MySQL as user
mysql -u exampleuser -h localhost -p
mysql -u exampleuser -h localhost -pp92ls8qkau28
```
# code-server

`code-server` is [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) running on a
remote server, accessible through the browser.

- **Consistent environment:** Code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a
  consistent dev environment. develop more easily for Linux if you have a
  Windows or Mac, and pick up where you left off when switching workstations.
- **Server-powered:** Take advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests,
  compilations, downloads, and more. Preserve battery life when you're on the go
  since all intensive computation runs on your server.

### Requirements

- Minimum GLIBC version of 2.17 and a minimum version of GLIBCXX of 3.4.15.
  - This is the main requirement for building Visual Studio Code. We cannot go lower than this.
- A 64-bit host with at least 1GB RAM and 2 cores.
  - 1 core hosts would work but not optimally.
- Docker (for Docker versions of `code-server`).

### Known Issues

- Creating custom VS Code extensions and debugging them doesn't work.
- Extension profiling and tips are currently disabled.

### Extensions

`code-server` does not provide access to the official
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). Instead,
Coder has created a custom extension marketplace that we manage for open-source
extensions. If you want to use an extension with code-server that we do not have
in our marketplace please look for a release in the extensionâ€™s repository,
contact us to see if we have one in the works or, if you build an extension
locally from open source, you can copy it to the `extensions` folder. If you
build one locally from open-source please contribute it to the project and let
us know so we can give you props! If you have your own custom marketplace, it is
possible to point code-server to it by setting the `SERVICE_URL` and `ITEM_URL`
environment variables.

### Telemetry

Use the `--disable-telemetry` flag to completely disable telemetry. We use the
data collected to improve code-server.

### Upgrading VS Code
